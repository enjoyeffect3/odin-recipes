    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Alright, y'all, listen up. I'm about to show you how we stuff these pork chops right, the way it's meant to be done. Ain't no half-steppin' here. I'm gon' break it down real simple: we ain't just throwin' stuff in the middle for the sake of it. Nah, we flavorin' that pork from the inside out-gettin' it all juicy, all tender, all the way through.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 strips bacon, sliced into 0.25-inch pieces </li>
        <li>0.5 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper</li>
        <li>1 large yellow peach, peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
        <li>8 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) with oven rack in center position.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper; cook until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add peach; cook until tender and starting to render some juice. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir saltines, thyme, black pepper, 0.25 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper into peach mixture; add 2 tablespoons chicken broth to moisten as needed. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Lay pork chops flat onto your work surface. Cut a pocket in center of each pork chop, starting with a small incision on fat side of chops, exactly halfway down, using the tip of a knife to cut as close to the edges as possible without poking through. Try to make pocket incisions at least 2 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Fill pockets with peach stuffing, packing and pressing in firmly; season both sides chops with salt.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chops; sear until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip chops and transfer skillet to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers reads 145 degrees F to 150 degrees F, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chops to a plate; cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to the stovetop; place a towel over the hot handle. Add 0.25 cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Off heat, stir in butter. Taste; adjust seasoning if desired. Serve sauce over pork chops.</li>
    </ol>
